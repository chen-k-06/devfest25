    <h2>Our Mission </h2>
    <p>We believe in fostering an inclusive and accessible environment for all members of our community.
    Accessible Columbia is designed to provide a comprehensive resource for students, faculty, and visitors who require accessible routes and facilities across campus. <br><br>
    This platform compiles detailed information about the most accessible paths throughout the university, highlighting accessibility markers at every building entrance, dining hall, and campus facility.
    Use the search function on the front page to plan your routes, select markers to find which buildings, dining halls, and entrances are accessible! <br><br>
    We aim to make it easier for everyone to navigate Columbia with confidence, whether you are heading to class, dining, or attending an event.
    In addition, we provide real-time updates on accessibility alerts, keeping you informed of any disruptions or changes to campus routes. Should you encounter any issues, our easy-to-use interface allows you to report repairs directly to Hartley Hospitality for swift action. <br><br>
    Our mission is simple: to ensure that all members of the Columbia community can experience the campus to its fullest, with ease and accessibility at every step.
